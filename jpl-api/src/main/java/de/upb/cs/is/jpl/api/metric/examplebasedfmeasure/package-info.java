/**
 * This package contains the implementation of the example based F-measure (as presented in the
 * paper "A Review on Multi-Label Learning Algorithms" by Min-Ling Zhang and Zhi-Hua Zhou) and
 * associated classes. Furthermore the example based versions of precision and recall are
 * implemented to facilitate in the computation of the measure. Nevertheless they can also be used
 * as standalone example based measures.
