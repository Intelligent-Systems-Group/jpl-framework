 * Provides abstract classes, interfaces and {@link java.lang.Enum}(s) required for the
 * implementation of any type of evaluation It also contains the evaluation configuration abstract
 * classes which extends abstract Json configuration class, which is used to convert the default
 * json configuration for the corresponding class and also to store some extra parameters required
 * for running the whole evaluation process. This class contains a class called the
