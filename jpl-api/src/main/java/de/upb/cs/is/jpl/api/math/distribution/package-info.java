/**
 * This package contains the architecture for probability distributions inside the jPL framework.
 * For each type of distribution a special sub package exists. Each distribution added to the
 * framework should be added to its own package as a sub sub package of this package according to
 * the type of the distribution, e.g. a distribution on the real numbers.
