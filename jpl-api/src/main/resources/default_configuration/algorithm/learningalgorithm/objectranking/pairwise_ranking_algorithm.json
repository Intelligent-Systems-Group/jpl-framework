Example for ranking i1>i2, instance with feature(i1-i2) and class 1 or instance with feature(x2-x1) and class -1 is created and classifier dataset has equal number of +1 and -1 instances. For order-svm the there will be a threshold point say t, very object ranked before t index is classified as +1 and others -1. And we do this for multiple values of t from 1 to L-1 (L is minimum number of objects ranked in the dataset) "
