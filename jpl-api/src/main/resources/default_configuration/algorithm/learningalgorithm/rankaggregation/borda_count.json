For each voter, the top ranked candidate is given c points, the second ranked candidate is given câˆ’1 points, and so on. If there are some candidates left unranked by the voter, the remaining points are divided evenly among the unranked candidates. The candidates are ranked in order of total points, and the candidate with the most points wins the election.\\\" (Aslam, J. A., & Montague, M. , 2001, p. 3)",
