/**
 * This package contains all classes associated with the {@code RunCompleteToolChainCommand}. In
 * particular it hosts the command itself, its configuration and the according handler.
 * 
 * The {@code RunCompleteToolChainCommandOutputGenerator} is used to format the final output of the
 * command. This is done as the output formatting is more complex for this command, as it aggregates
 * the output of several other commands.
