/**
 * This package contains the implementation of {@code EvaluateAlgorithmsCommand}. The command has
 * two main classes one is {@code EvaluateAlgorithmsCommandConfiguration} which contains the
 * parameters related to evaluation of the algorithms and other is
 * {@code EvaluateAlgorithmsCommandHandler} which parses the command line and creates the
 * EvaluateAlgorithmsCommand and interpret the {@link de.upb.cs.is.jpl.cli.command.CommandResult}
 * after execution and set it to {@link java.util.Observer}.
